#+title: Procare Photo Timestamper

* About

This repository contains a simple script and instructions for downloading a single month's photos from the "Photos" gallery on the "Dashboard" pane of Procare Connect's online interface. It was created because of a change in Procare API in June 2023 which breaks [[JWally]]'s [[https://github.com/JWally/procare-media-downloader][procare-media-downloader]].

Currently, this only supports downloading a single month's photos at once, unlike its predecessor. However, I find this suitable as I try to download all photos at each month's end anyways.

* Instructions

#+CAPTION: Go to the dashboard and click on "Photos/Videos"

#+CAPTION: Select "Monthly", set the month, and scroll to the bottom of the gallery to load all the photos you'd like to download.

In a Chromium browser, from the toolbar click "View" > "Developer" > "JavaScript Console".

Then either paste the code of [[./download.js][download.js]] directly into the console (recommended for safety), or (risky) paste

```javascript
fetch('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jsigman/procare-media-scraper/main/download.js')
  .then(res => res.text())
  .then(code => eval(code));
```

And give the permission to your browser to download the images.

* Timestamping

Timestamping of photos is possible through the filenames of the downloaded images. However, because of an external dependency on ~exiftool~, right now this has to be run separately in python. See my implementation at [[https://github.com/jsigman/procare-photo-timestamper][here]].
